## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-23

### Critical Fixes

#### Database Auto-Configuration
The app now **automatically configures the database** - no manual setup needed!

- **FIXED**: `DATABASE_URL not found` error that prevented articles from loading
- **FIXED**: App now starts successfully even without `.env` file
- **FIXED**: Database path defaults to `./db/custom.db` automatically

### Changed

- **Database Module** (`src/lib/db.ts`)
  - Added automatic DATABASE_URL fallback to `file:./db/custom.db`
  - Added `isDbAvailable()` function to check database status
  - Added `getDbError()` function to get last error
  - Added `getDbUrl()` function to get current database URL
  - Improved logging for troubleshooting

- **Environment Files** (`.env`, `.env.example`)
  - Updated with clearer instructions
  - Better organized sections
  - Clear indication that NO configuration is needed

### Why This Matters

Previously, users had to:
1. Create `.env` file manually
2. Add `DATABASE_URL="file:./db/custom.db"`
3. Run `prisma generate`
4. Hope it worked

Now:
1. Just run `bun run dev` - that's it!

The app handles all database configuration automatically.
